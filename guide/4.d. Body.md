# 4.d. Body

In this section, we will be installing our main mod for changing the body of our player character, and the characters in the game world.

> [!WARNING]
> This section contains mods marked as NSFW on the Nexus. Additionally, they are mods that deal with nudity, but not sexual content. If this is uncomfortable for you, feel free to skip this section entirely. Beyond this point, all content in this section can be assumed to be unsafe for work. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Additionally, the modlist is intended to be played be a female player character (PC). This is because I am a woman.

That doesn't mean that we won't also make changes to the male player and non-player character models, just that it is less of a priority in getting absolutely right.

## For Women (Female model-specific)

Our core body mod of choice will be [BHUNP (UUNP Next Generation) SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126).

It is a combination of the old UNP body with changes, additions, and advancements that make it ideal for us to use as a base to build characters on top of.

It is the best of all worlds in terms of improvement to bodies, and more importantly, it is BodySlide compatible, meaning that all outfits that were made for CBBE or BodySlide or any of these similar mods are all compatible with this body, with a few tweaks.

Secondarily, we will be using the [BnP - Female skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274) as our body skin, since BHUNP does not provide a skin texture of its own. In fact, as far as possible we will be using the BnP series of mods for our purposes.

### Installation

Similar to previous sections, the installation process is rather complex, so you should not start Skyrim from here on out unless otherwise told to do so.

1. Follow the installation of Pandora, the updated replacement to Nemesis and FNIS. You can find truncated install instructions in section `2. Tooling`.
2. Install the following mods. This is for installing XPMSSE with Pandora:
    - [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)
    - [XPMSSE - Nemesis - Papyrus Stack Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60363) -- Both the "Last Version" and the "Small compatibility update".
    - [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - Fixed Scripts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44252)
    - [Optimised Scripts for XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82774) (version 4.8.4) -- Put this below the Fixed Scripts mod.
    - [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988) -- Ensure that this loses to all conflicts. - FOMOD options:
        - Installation: Extended
        - Animation Rig Map: XPMS(S)E Latest
        - Ingame Customizing/Character and Weapons: RaceMenu + XPMS(S)E MCM
3. To check if you have installed XPMSSE correctly, you may launch Skyrim now. You should see XPMSSE in the MCM menu with messages from the mod author saying "You barely made it."
4. Install the following mods. This is for installing FSMP.
    - [ConsoleUtilSSE NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649)
    - [JContainers SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16495)
    - [SMP-NPC crash fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91616)
    - [FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339) - FOMOD options:
        - Skyrim version: 1.6.1170.
        - CUDA or not: NOT CUDA.
        - AVX: AVX or AVX2, depending. If your CPU doesn't support either, you should not be installing this modlist because yours is way too out of date.
        - Configuration: Install FSMPM.
        - Autofill for the rest.
5. Follow the installation of BodySlide and Outfit Studio. You can find truncated install instructions in section `2. Tooling`.
6. Install the following mods. This is for installing the body skin texture.
    - [Wet Function Redux SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78804?tab=description).
    - [Soaking Wet - Character Wetness Effect](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68025)
    - [DVA - Dynamic Vampire Appearance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96817)
    - [BnP - Female Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274) -- Choose the `BnP female skin 4k (UNP Player and Replacer)` option. - FOMOD options:
        - Honestly whatever you want. We will be installing RSV further on so you don't have to worry too much about this.
        - Ensure you opt in to the fixes. I'm not sharing my personal config cause it's up to you to decide what you want here.
7. Install the following mods. These are the direct pre-requisites for BHUNP.
    - [CBPC - Physics with Collisions for SSE and VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224) - FOMOD options:
        - Autofills are generally fine. Body Shape can be any because we will be building in BodySlide.
        - FPS can be any. I suggest 120 fps.
        - Bounce config can be any as well.
    - [RaceCompatibility for Skyrim Special Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2853) - FOMOD options:
        - Optional Vampire overhaul patches (Dawnguard): Sacrosanct.
        - The rest should be autofilled.
8. Finally, install [BHUNP (UUNP Next Generation) SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126). - FOMOD options:
    - Collision Physics/Physics Select: SMP + CBPC(Most parts A)
    - Choose whatever physics presets you want.
    - Young Nord Race: Up to you.
    - Unique Character: No Unique Character Bodyslide.
9. Ensure that the BnP female skin textures win in the conflict with BHUNP's textures.
10. Open up BodySlide through MO2.
11. On Outfit/Body, select BHUNP 3BBB Advanced Ver 4
12. On Preset, pick whatever suits your fancy. You can use the "Preview" Button above the big "Build" button to get a preview of what you might get in game.
13. Once you have selected a body type you like, hit "Build".
14. Repeat this process for the BHUNP 3BBB Collision Armor SMP, Hands Version 3, and Feet as well. as well. Letters correspond to cup size.
15. Close BodySlide.
16. Launch Skyrim.

This has been extensive, but if you did ***everything*** right, when you launch Skyrim, a bunch of things should happen.

1. You should see a bunch of menus in the MCM. Important one is the BHUNP 3BBB Addon.
2. If you `showracemenu` and change your sex to female, then remove your armor, you should see all the goodies in front of you.
3. Running around in that state and jumping should give you *the bounce*.
4. Changing the weather to rain, or taking a dip in your most convenient body of water should also give you a glistening coat on your character's body.

This is where we can leave it, but this is not where we stop changing our body. After we are done doing the male body, we will be revisiting this with Racial Skin Variance (RSV).
