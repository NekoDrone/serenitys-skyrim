# 4.c. Cabbage ENB

Cabbage ENB is our ENB preset of choice. It is comprehensive, gorgeous, and is integrated extremely well with NAT 3, our weather mod of choice.

The reason I'm extracting this out into its own section is because it's complex and can get messy. This guide gives you the right order of things to install, and how to install them.

The guide isn't going to deviate much from the install instructions on the Nexus page, but it will hold your hand so that the installation is less messy.

It is recommended (but optional) that before you proceed with installing the ENB preset, you skip ahead to installing SkyUI from the next section, 4.d. User Interface. This is entirely to make Skyrim's UI not be in the way when you're testing the preset and changes.

Additionally, you might want to consider using Reshade as well. The recommended Reshade preset for this modlist is [Celestial Aura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93358).

While installing Cabbage ENB, you shouldn't launch Skyrim until it's complete.

- [Silent Horizons 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101696)
- [Cabbage ENB for NAT 3 Weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103042) - Use the Lux version with the Parallax `.ini`.

### 3. Load Order

Ensure that the following is set in your load order. This is a general guideline so don't be concerned if there are other mods in-between.

MO2's Left Panel:
- NAT 3
- Particle Patch for ENB
- Lux
- ENB Light
- Embers XD
- Embers XD - Fire Them Sparks

MO2's Right Panel (Plugins tab):
- `Particle Patch for ENB.esp`
- `NAT-ENB.esp`
- `Ember XD.esp`
- `Lux.esp`
- `Lux - Embers XD patch.esp `

## A note on Lux

Lux is extensive. The two side mods Orbis and Via are also equally extensive. The Patch Hubs for all three of these mods are incredible helpers, but for now, we don't need any options from them.

In the future, when we finish installing all of our various mods and extensions, all we need to do is hit the reinstall button on MO2 for each of these patch hubs, and we're good to go with compatibility patches for Lux and it's two side mods.

## A note on big compatibility patches

In general, when we are done with adding our mods of choice, all the mods on this list need to be "reinstalled" with MO2 so that the FOMOD installers will automatically give us the compatibility patches we need for each of these mods.

I'm not bothering to note down which options belong to where, because I want to simplify the install as much as possible wherever I can.

## (Optional) For darker nights.

I personally prefer it when nights are a little bit darker than what Cabbage ENB provides. If you would like a similar experience, you can open up the `enbadaptation.fx.ini` file in the Cabbage ENB mod in MO2, and set
`Adaptation.|- Night - Exposure Compensation (in EVs)=-0.5`
