# 4.b. Core Patches and Tweaks

This is mostly existent as a set of base changes, tweaks, fixes, and engine-level modifications that don't really do anything, but provide a platform for us to build our mods on.

For all of these mods, unless specified otherwise, you can download and install them directly through MO2.

## Exceptions

The above mods can all be installed through MO2 as usual, they're all either mods in and of themselves, or they're SKSE plugins.

The exception here is SSE Engine Fixes, which comes in two parts. A SKSE pre-loader which must be installed as a root mod.

It doesn't provide any game files, so MO2 will complain, but you can fix that by following the Root Builder empty root mod guide in Section 3. Pre-modding/b. Skyrim Script Extender (skse)/Key points.
