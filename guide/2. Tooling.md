# 2. Tooling

This section describes additional external tooling that you should have at the ready in order to perform certain actions that are required for the mod to work. You should skip this section until a tool is mentioned further down in the guide, then come back here to reference information regarding what it's meant to do, how to install the tool, and how to use the tool, along with common terms and phrases regarding the tool.

## Tools
 
### SSEEdit

The ubiquitous xEdit, specific to Skyrim: Special Edition. It is a deconflicting tool/decompiler, lets you clean plugins, increasing game stability. Can also use to merge plugins to help manage the 255 limit.

#### Installing

1. Download it from [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) or [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164).
2. Extract it to some directory.
3. Add it to MO2 or run it however you want.

#### Usage

[WIP] for now, but if you need to load stuff, just ensure that you load the minimal amount of plugins that you need to see any conflicts.

### Bethini Pie

Bethini Pie (Performance INI Editor) is a tool to edit your in-game INI configuration files. It exposes options that aren't normally available to you when changing options in the game launcher. Technically supports both LE and SE, as well as FO4 and Starfield, but we're using it specifically for SE.

#### Installing

1. Download it from [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/DoubleYouC/Bethini-Pie-Performance-INI-Editor) or [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/631).
2. Extract it to some directory.
3. Add it to MO2 or run it however you want.

#### Usage

As mentioned in both the Nexus description and on startup launch, since we are using MO2, we should leave the locations as default so that the VFS redirections on MO2 will work correctly.

For the actual recommended settings, follow the [Step Modifications guide](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:2.3#02-Extenders) for the "BethINI Pie Settings" section. You can opt for the Ultra preset.

### Synthesis

### Pandora Behaviour Engine Plus

Pandora is the modern replacement to Nemesis, which itself is a replacement for FNIS.

If a mod specifies FNIS in its requirements, then Nemesis would have worked as a replacement. Now, Pandora also works as a replacement and is likely the one to stick around.

Additionally, if a mod specifies Nemesis as a requirement, then Pandora can fill that requirement.

Pandora has superceded Nemesis and FNIS.

#### Installing

I recommend that you use the stable version of Pandora, and not a bleeding edge version from GitHub.

1. Download the stable release from Nexus [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133232?tab=description). You should download it through MO2. If you want to you can use the GitHub version, but support is less guaranteed.
2. Install the mod through MO2.
3. Add the executable as normal through MO2. Don't close the dialog.
4. In the "Start in" field for Pandora, set it to your actual Skyrim `Data` directory. Leave the "Create files in mod instead of overwrite" option UNticked.
5. Create an empty mod called "Pandora Output". Copy the path to that mod's directory.
6. Launch Pandora.
7. In the top left, click on Paths > Game and set it to your actual `SkyrimSE.exe` file in your `steamapps` folder.
8. In the top left, click on Paths > Output and set it to the "Pandora Output" mod directory that you copied earlier.

#### Usage

Every time you install a new animation mod, or mod that requires a change in Pandora, you must run a generation in Pandora.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Launch Pandora
2. Select the options that are required. Options should be cumulative and contain all of the options on one go.
3. Click the big "Play" button at the bottom of Pandora.

If you have set up Pandora's output to be a mod in the load order already, then you are done and can close Pandora and launch the game. If not, you must perform the regular overwrite create mod process. This is not recommended and you should have set up Pandora's output to be a mod.

### BodySlide and Outfit Studio

BodySlide and Outfit Studio is a combination of two programs that work similarly to each other. BodySlide helps you ensure compatibility between various "BodySlide-compatible" body mods, and Outfit Studio does the same but specifically for outfits.

What this means for you, the user, is that if you come across an outfit that you really like, but it doesn't have meshes for your installed body mod, you can use Outfit Studio to automagically generate the mesh for you.

#### Installation

Do NOT install this until the appropriate time in the modding guide (4.d. Body).

1. Download the latest stable release from [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015). You should do this through MO2.
2. Install the mod through MO2. Automatically selected FOMOD options are correct.
3. Create two empty mods, one for "BodySlide Output" and one for "Outfit Studio Output".
4. Add the executables as normal through MO2. Don't close the dialog.
5. In the "Start in" fields for both programs, set it to your actual Skyrim `Data` directory.
6. For each program, check the "Create files in mod instead of overwrite" option, setting each program's outputs to each empty mod created earlier.

#### Usage

TBD
