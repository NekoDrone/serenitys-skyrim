# 2. Tooling

This section describes additional external tooling that you should have at the ready in order to perform certain actions that are required for the mod to work. You should skip this section until a tool is mentioned further down in the guide, then come back here to reference information regarding what it's meant to do, how to install the tool, and how to use the tool, along with common terms and phrases regarding the tool.

## Tools
 
### SSEEdit

The ubiquitous xEdit, specific to Skyrim: Special Edition. It is a deconflicting tool/decompiler, lets you clean plugins, increasing game stability. Can also use to merge plugins to help manage the 255 limit.

#### Installing

1. Download it from [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) or [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164).
2. Extract it to some directory.
3. Add it to MO2 or run it however you want.

#### Usage

[WIP] for now, but if you need to load stuff, just ensure that you load the minimal amount of plugins that you need to see any conflicts.

### Bethini Pie

Bethini Pie (Performance INI Editor) is a tool to edit your in-game INI configuration files. It exposes options that aren't normally available to you when changing options in the game launcher. Technically supports both LE and SE, as well as FO4 and Starfield, but we're using it specifically for SE.

#### Installing

1. Download it from [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/DoubleYouC/Bethini-Pie-Performance-INI-Editor) or [here (Nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/631).
2. Extract it to some directory.
3. Add it to MO2 or run it however you want.

#### Usage

As mentioned in both the Nexus description and on startup launch, since we are using MO2, we should leave the locations as default so that the VFS redirections on MO2 will work correctly.

For the actual recommended settings, follow the [Step Modifications guide](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:2.3#02-Extenders) for the "BethINI Pie Settings" section. You can opt for the Ultra preset.
